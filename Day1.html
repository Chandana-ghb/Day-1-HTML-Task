		    <b>HTML</b>is the standards for 
		    <u><strong>Hyper Test Markup Language</strong></u> it is used for documents designed to be 	                       displayed in a web browser.It defines the content and structure of web 	        	                       content.It is often assisted by technologies such as 
		    <strong>Cascading Style Sheets.</strong> and scripting languages such as JavaScript,a 	                    programming language.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 			    local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<b>HTML</b>			    describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues 		            for its appearance.</br></br>
                    <b><big><i>HTML</i></big></b> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
		    <em><big>With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be 			     embedded into the rendered page.<b>HTML</b> provides a means to create structured 			     documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as <ins>headings, 			     paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.</ins></big></em> 
		    <b>HTML</b> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as 			     and directly introduce content into the page. 
		    <small>Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may 			     include sub-element tags.</small> Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use 			     them to interpret the content of the page.</br></br>
		    <b>HTML</b> can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which 		             affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the 			     look and layout of content. The <strong><ins>World Wide Web Consortium</ins>			     </strong>, former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the <strong>			     CSS</strong> standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit   	   	            	     presentational HTML since <b>1997</b>.A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to 			     display video and audio,primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.

HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references.
The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.
